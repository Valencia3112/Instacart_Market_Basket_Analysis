# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## Introduction
Instacart is an e-commerce website that allows users to shop for groceries from a local grocery
store online, and then sends an Instacart personal shopper to pick up and deliver the orders made
by users the same day. Instacart uses transactional data to develop models that predict which
products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session.
These processes allow retailers to conduct analysis on purchase iterations by users but
understanding the customer purchasing patterns and behaviors can become tedious and
challenging. There are three ways that Instacart generates revenue: delivery fees, membership fees,
and mark-ups on in-store prices.

## Objective
• Predict the chances for likely reorder of the same product by users, based on their previous purchase history
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to find important information about customer’s buying patterns such as: busiest day of
  the week, hour of day, most purchased items, most popular products, most popular department, aisle, etc.
